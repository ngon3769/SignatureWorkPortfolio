# Signature Work Portfolio for Bifuh Ngongalah

This e-portfolio showcases my journey as a student at the University of St. Thomas, connecting my academic work to the mission and values of the university and the broader concept of the common good. Through the three highlighted projects, I will reflect on how each piece of work addresses societal challenges, incorporates interdisciplinary knowledge, and contributes to a shared vision of progress and ethical responsibility. The reflection ties these projects to the university's commitment to advancing the common good through education, faith, and community engagement.

## Project 1: Personal Tracker for College Students

Link to Project: [Personal Tracker Project](https://github.com/ngon3769/Personal-Tracker-Project/tree/main)

This project was a homework assignment for my database design (CISC 450) class. It was broken up into two parts:

**Part 1:** Designing the database schema, setting it up with SQLAlchemy and SQLite, and populating it with data.

**Part 2:** Using the database to create a fully functional web server and web page (user interface) to interact with the database.

The motivation behind this project was the challenges students face in managing their complex lives. As a student juggling classes, assignments, work, and extracurricular activities, I've seen how easy it is to feel overwhelmed. What started as a database design assignment became a reflection of what students actually like myself need; a comprehensive way to see how all pieces of their lives fit together. Though the project currently only supports academic deadlines, future iterations will incorporate other aspects of student life like work and extracurriculars to help them stay on top of things. By designing features that track both academic deadlines and personal commitments, the tracker will acknowledge that student life isn't just about classes. It's about managing energy, maintaining relationships, and finding balance.

What makes this meaningful is how it helps students take control of their time and reduce anxiety about missing important deadlines or commitments. Having everything in one place means one less thing to worry about, which aligns perfectly with St. Thomas's goal of advancing the common good, particularly by supporting students' mental health and overall success.

## Project 2: Paper on Exploring Gender and Religious Bias in LLMs

Link to Paper: [Paper on Exploring Gender and Religious Bias in LLMs](https://github.com/ngon3769/SignatureWorkPortfolio/blob/main/Exploring%20Gender%20and%20Religious%20Bias%20in%20Large%20Language%20Models.pdf)

This paper was written for my Summa Cum Laude Oral Examination. At the University of St. Thomas, students with a GPA â‰¥ 3.90 have the option to take the Summa Cum Laude oral exam to receive the Latin Honor upon graduation. My interdisciplinary approach combined Computer Science, Theology, and Women/Gender Studies. 

The paper examines:

- The nature of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their increasing societal relevance.

- Manifestations of gender and religious biases in LLMs, supported by examples.

- How these biases become embedded during training.

- Recommendations for mitigating these biases to ensure ethical AI development.

- The potential consequences of unchecked biases in LLMs.

The discussions during the oral exam provided some additional insight and considerations, like why developers might be disincentivized to spend time addressing these biases during development.

Working on this project showed me just how deeply intertwined technology and social issues are. As I dove into the research about gender and religious biases in Large Language Models, I discovered patterns that traced back decades before AI existed. The same gender stereotypes that kept women out of computer science in the 1960s were showing up in modern AI systems, just in more subtle ways. For instance, when given prompts about leadership roles, these models often defaulted to male pronouns, while caregiving roles defaulted to female pronouns.

The religious biases were equally concerning. I found that LLMs often displayed oversimplified or stereotypical views of different faiths, particularly minority religions. This wasn't surprising given that these models learn from internet data, which reflects centuries of historical prejudices and power dynamics. What struck me most was how these biases could silently scale - a single biased model could affect millions of users, perpetuating these stereotypes in ways that would be hard to detect or correct.

This research embodied St. Thomas's commitment to advancing the common good through critical examination of complex issues. By analyzing these biases from both technical and humanistic perspectives, I learned that since AI is taught to recognize patterns instead of understanding context, to build ethical AI it is up to the creators to make the conscious effort to understand and address the historical and social contexts that shape our technology. 

The most valuable lesson wasn't just identifying these biases but understanding why they persist. Companies often prioritize rapid development over careful bias mitigation, viewing it as an optional feature rather than a core requirement. This helped me realize that as a future developer, I have a responsibility to advocate for ethical considerations in AI development, even when it might be easier or more profitable to ignore them.

This work integrates technical, social, and theological insights to address a critical issue. From a theological perspective, it emphasizes the importance of recognizing human dignity and preventing harm through technology. Incorporating feminist theory helped explore the structural roots of bias, connecting social systems to computational models. By combining these perspectives, the paper proposes solutions that balance technical rigor with ethical considerations, showcasing the importance of interdisciplinary thinking in solving modern challenges.


Bias in AI has wide-ranging consequences, from reinforcing stereotypes to influencing decisions in fields like hiring or law enforcement. Addressing these biases is not just a technical challenge but a moral imperative. This project reflects the university's commitment to the common good by advocating for ethical AI systems that respect the dignity and rights of all individuals. Its recommendations aim to minimize harm and promote fairness, contributing to a more just technological landscape.


## Project 3: Internship Project

Link to Project Description: [Internship Project](https://github.com/ngon3769/Internship-Project/tree/main)

During my Software Engineer Internship at an enterprise software company (May-August 2024), I developed an email delivery workflow for release update notifications. My task was to create a new resilient, adabtable, and robust system with real-time observability into the email delivery process.

The previous system lacked the necessary observability to track email delivery effectively, causing delays and frustration for both clients and internal teams. Without a way to monitor or address issues promptly, customer trust in the system was undermined.

To solve this, I designed and implemented a new email delivery workflow using Netflix Conductor for orchestration, Amazon SQS/DLQ for message queuing and failure handling, and Java/Spring Boot for the core application logic. This solution introduced real-time monitoring tools that provided detailed insights into email delivery processes, enabling teams to proactively resolve problems.

Key features of the workflow included:

- Resilience: Retry mechanisms and dead-letter queues to manage and recover from failures gracefully.
- Transparency: A user-friendly monitoring dashboard for tracking the status of email jobs in real time.
- Efficiency: Improved reliability, ensuring critical notifications reached their intended recipients without delays.
By focusing on these aspects, I contributed to a system that not only met technical requirements but also enhanced the overall customer experience.

### Common Good Perspective:

Observability is key to building trust and satisfaction in any software system. This project shows how technical improvements can boost communication and transparency, creating stronger partnerships. Reliable notifications help build trust between the company and its clients, forming the foundation for lasting relationships.

This project also taught me an important lesson about impact that aligns with St. Thomas's mission of serving others through our work. While building the email delivery system, I initially focused on the technical challenges - implementing retry mechanisms, setting up monitoring dashboards, and ensuring reliable delivery. But watching the internal teams at the company use my system during my final weeks transformed my perspective as a developer. Before my solution, these teams struggled daily with a frustrating lack of visibility into email deliveries, making it hard to help customers troubleshooting their notification issues. Seeing them confidently use the workflow I built to quickly resolve problems showed me how technical solutions can directly improve people's work lives. The system now supports over 55,000 customer companies, but what matters most is how it helps both internal teams and customers feel more confident in their daily operations.

This experience reshaped how I approach software development. I learned that when programming, it's not just about solving technical problems but also understanding the human impact of our solutions. Now, when I work with software, I think beyond just functionality and efficiency. I consider how my work will affect the people using it.

## Conclusion

These three projects demonstrate the intersection of technical skill, interdisciplinary knowledge, and a commitment to the common good. They showcase my ability to approach problems holistically, considering both technical and human dimensions.
