## Project 1: Personal Tracker for College Students

Project Link: [https://github.com/users/ngon3769/projects/1](https://github.com/ngon3769/Personal-Tracker-Project/tree/main)

This project was a homework assignment for my database design (CISC 450) class. It was broken up into 2 parts:
- Part 1: Designing the database schema, setting it up with SQLAlchemy and SQLite, and populating it with data.
- Part 2: Using the database to create a fully functional web server and web page (user interface) to interact with the database.


## Project 2: Paper on Exploring Gender and Religious Bias in LLMs

I wrote this paper for my Summa Cum Laude oral examination. The goal was to incorporate 3 distinct disciplines, so I chose
Computer Science (my major), Theology, and Women/Gender Studies.

## Project 3: Atlassian Internship Project

I interned as a Software Engineer Intern at Atlassian from May - Aug 2024. The code I wrote for my project cannot be linked
here, but here is a link to the project description.
