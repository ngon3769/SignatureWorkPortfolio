# Signature Work Portfolio for Bifuh Ngongalah

This e-portfolio showcases my journey as a student at the University of St. Thomas, connecting my academic work to the mission and values of the university and the broader concept of the common good. Through the three highlighted projects, I will reflect on how each piece of work addresses societal challenges, incorporates interdisciplinary knowledge, and contributes to a shared vision of progress and ethical responsibility. The reflection ties these projects to the university's commitment to advancing the common good through education, faith, and community engagement.

## Project 1: Personal Tracker for College Students

Link to Project: [Personal Tracker Project](https://github.com/ngon3769/Personal-Tracker-Project/tree/main)

This project was a homework assignment for my database design (CISC 450) class. It was broken up into two parts:

**Part 1:** Designing the database schema, setting it up with SQLAlchemy and SQLite, and populating it with data.

**Part 2:** Using the database to create a fully functional web server and web page (user interface) to interact with the database.

The Personal Tracker project addresses a common problem faced by college students: managing tasks, schedules, and resources effectively. By creating a tool that organizes and visualizes personal data, this project promotes academic success and mental well-being. It exemplifies the use of technology as a tool for empowerment, aligning with St. Thomas's value of serving others through knowledge and innovation.

While rooted in computer science, this project ties into psychology and education. Effective time management and organization are well-studied contributors to student success. By incorporating these principles, I was able to design a system that supports healthy habits and reduces stress. Moreover, the user interface design considered accessibility and inclusivity to ensure the tracker could be used by a diverse population of students.

The broader impact of tools like this is significant. As technology increasingly shapes our lives, accessible and user-friendly systems can democratize resources and enable individuals to achieve their goals. This project embodies the idea that technology should serve humanity. By supporting students' academic and personal development, the tracker contributes to a more equitable and flourishing educational environment.

## Project 2: Paper on Exploring Gender and Religious Bias in LLMs

Link to Paper: [Paper on Exploring Gender and Religious Bias in LLMs](https://github.com/ngon3769/SignatureWorkPortfolio/blob/main/Exploring%20Gender%20and%20Religious%20Bias%20in%20Large%20Language%20Models.pdf)

This paper was written for my Summa Cum Laude Oral Examination. At the University of St. Thomas, students with a GPA â‰¥ 3.90 have the option to take the Summa Cum Laude oral exam to receive the Latin Honor upon graduation. My interdisciplinary approach combined Computer Science, Theology, and Women/Gender Studies. 

The paper examines:

- The nature of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their increasing societal relevance.

- Manifestations of gender and religious biases in LLMs, supported by examples.

- How these biases become embedded during training.

- Recommendations for mitigating these biases to ensure ethical AI development.

- The potential consequences of unchecked biases in LLMs.

The discussions during the oral exam provided some additional insight and considerations, like why developers might be disincentivized to spend time addressing these biases during development.

This work integrates technical, social, and theological insights to address a critical issue. From a theological perspective, it emphasizes the importance of recognizing human dignity and preventing harm through technology. Incorporating feminist theory helped explore the structural roots of bias, connecting social systems to computational models. By combining these perspectives, the paper proposes solutions that balance technical rigor with ethical considerations, showcasing the importance of interdisciplinary thinking in solving modern challenges.


Bias in AI has wide-ranging consequences, from reinforcing stereotypes to influencing decisions in fields like hiring or law enforcement. Addressing these biases is not just a technical challenge but a moral imperative. This project reflects the university's commitment to the common good by advocating for ethical AI systems that respect the dignity and rights of all individuals. Its recommendations aim to minimize harm and promote fairness, contributing to a more just technological landscape.


## Project 3: Internship Project

Link to Project Description: [Internship Project](https://github.com/ngon3769/Internship-Project)

During my Software Engineer Internship at an enterprise software company (May-August 2024), I developed an email delivery workflow for release update notifications. My task was to create a new resilient, adabtable, and robust system with real-time observability into the email delivery process.

The previous system lacked the necessary observability to track email delivery effectively, causing delays and frustration for both clients and internal teams. Without a way to monitor or address issues promptly, customer trust in the system was undermined.

To solve this, I designed and implemented a new email delivery workflow using Netflix Conductor for orchestration, Amazon SQS/DLQ for message queuing and failure handling, and Java/Spring Boot for the core application logic. This solution introduced real-time monitoring tools that provided detailed insights into email delivery processes, enabling teams to proactively resolve problems.

Key features of the workflow included:

- Resilience: Retry mechanisms and dead-letter queues to manage and recover from failures gracefully.
- Transparency: A user-friendly monitoring dashboard for tracking the status of email jobs in real time.
- Efficiency: Improved reliability, ensuring critical notifications reached their intended recipients without delays.
By focusing on these aspects, I contributed to a system that not only met technical requirements but also enhanced the overall customer experience.

### Common Good Perspective:

Observability is key to building trust and satisfaction in any software system. This project shows how technical improvements can boost communication and transparency, creating stronger partnerships. Reliable notifications help build trust between the company and its clients, forming the foundation for lasting relationships.

While the project was mostly technical, it also involved design thinking and communication. I focused on making the monitoring dashboard easy to use and action-oriented, with reliability and resilience at its core. Beyond the technical aspects, it highlights the importance of transparency, reflecting values like accountability and stewardship.

By improving the reliability of release updates, this project helped strengthen the relationship between the company and its clients. It shows how technical work can create positive impact by fostering trust and supporting systems that prioritize transparency and reliability.

## Conclusion

These three projects demonstrate the intersection of technical skill, interdisciplinary knowledge, and a commitment to the common good. They showcase my ability to approach problems holistically, considering both technical and human dimensions. By addressing societal challenges, fostering inclusivity, and advancing ethical practices, my work aligns with the mission of the University of St. Thomas.
