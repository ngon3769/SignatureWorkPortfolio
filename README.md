## Project 1: Personal Tracker for College Students

Link to Project: [Personal Tracker Project](https://github.com/ngon3769/Personal-Tracker-Project/tree/main)

This project was a homework assignment for my database design (CISC 450) class. It was broken up into 2 parts:
- Part 1: Designing the database schema, setting it up with SQLAlchemy and SQLite, and populating it with data.
- Part 2: Using the database to create a fully functional web server and web page (user interface) to interact with the database.


## Project 2: Paper on Exploring Gender and Religious Bias in LLMs

Link to Paper: [Paper on Exploring Gender and Religious Bias in LLMs](https://github.com/ngon3769/SignatureWorkPortfolio/blob/main/Exploring%20Gender%20and%20Religious%20Bias%20in%20Large%20Language%20Models.pdf)

I wrote this paper on Exploring Gender and Religious Bias in LLMs for my Summa Cum Laude Oral Examination.

At the University of St. Thomas, students with a GPA >= 3.90 have the option to take the Summa Cum Laude oral exam to
recieve the Latin Honor upon graduation. I chose the option to write a paper and incorporated 3 disciplines: 
Computer Science, Theology, and Women/Gender Studies. I was tasked with creating a committe of three professors,
one from each of these disciplines. I chose the Department Chair for Computer Science, Dr. Sawin, to chair my
committe and chose Dr. Mark McInroy who I took a Theology class with and Dr. Emily James who I took a Women's
Literature class with as the other two.

The paper was sent out to them a week prior to the scheduled in-person exam, and they came to the exam with prepared
questions and discussion topics to assess my understanding of what I wrote on. After deliberation, it was a unanimous
decision that I passed the exam and will be getting the Honors at my graduation in May 2025.

Summarily, the paper addresses:

- What LLMs are and their increasing prevalence.
- What Gender and Religious bias entail, with examples.
- Ways that these biases manifest in LLMs.
- How these biases get embedded into LLMs.
- Suggestions on how to curb the propagation of these biases in LLMs.
- Implications of having these biases unchecked in LLMs.

The discussions during the oral exam provided some additional insight and considerations, like why developers might be disincentivized to spend time addressing these biases during development.

I interned as a Software Engineer Intern at an Enterprise Software company from May - Aug 2024. The code I wrote for my project cannot be linked
