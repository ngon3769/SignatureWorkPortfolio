This project was a homework assignment for my database design (CISC 450) class. It was broken up into 2 parts:
- Part 1: Designing the database schema, setting it up with SQLAlchemy and SQLite, and populating it with data.
- Part 2: Using the database to create a fully functional web server and web page (user interface) to interact with the database.

Computer Science (my major), Theology, and Women/Gender Studies.
